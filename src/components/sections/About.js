				<h2><span className="whoweare">Our </span>  Vision</h2>
				<p>
				The idea of Feasto was aroused from the complications caused by the global pandemic. Feasto wanted to ease the burden on businesses and make sure that everyone is staying safe. So Appvention Mediatech (Developers of Feasto) came up with a one-stop solution for the whole dine-in ecosystem. Through Feasto, customers will be able to reduce prolonged contact with restaurant waiters while taking their order and, so, they will be able to maintain social distancing. Businesses’ which are involved in the dine-in industry will be able to maintain their cash flow efficiently due to the lack of manpower required to run the business with the help of Feasto. <br/>

Our consumers will be able to download their app from the app store and the android play store. Through this app, the consumers will be able to order their desired meal by scanning the QR code on the table, upon ordering they will be able to make a payment from their phone itself, without having to approach the cashier counter.<br/><br/>
